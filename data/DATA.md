# Data sources and organisation

This guide provides an overview on how to download and organise most of the data sources used in the pipeline.

The folder tree used in this pipeline and stated in the [config file](../config.yml) is the following:

```{bash}

├── genomes
│   ├── aci

```


## Figures

Contains all the generated figures as well as some images used in the repo READMEs.


## GEM

Contains all GEMs generated by the [GEM notebook](../notebooks/00-Data.ipynb).


## Genomes

Contains all annotated genomes manually downloaded from their respective sources.
See the table below for more information.

## MetaNetX

Contains compound (chem_prop.tsv) and reaction (reac_prop.tsv) data downloaded from [MetaNetX](https://www.metanetx.org/mnxdoc/mnxref.html).


## MICOM

Contains the results for all MICOM analyses (check the [MICOM notebook](../notebooks/03-MICOM.ipynb)).
Ideally, one folder per study should be created (amils2023 in our case).
Subfolders separate different experiments performed using data from the same study.


## ModelSEED

Contains compound (compounds.tsv) and reaction (reactions.tsv) data downloaded from [ModelSEED](https://github.com/ModelSEED/ModelSEEDDatabase/tree/master/Biochemistry).


## Papers

Contains all data for the different studies being analysed (each in a subfolder).
In our case, we used information from [Amils et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.16291).


## RetroPath

Constains the results for all RetroPath analyses (check the [RetroPath notebook](../notebooks/02-RetroPath.ipynb)).
Ideally, one folder per study should be created (amils2023 and interesting_metabolites in our case).


## RetroPath classes

Contains metadata for exploring compound classes in RetroPath results.
This data is still not public and, thus, is not provided.


## RetroRules

Contrains the rules downloaded from [RetroRules](https://retrorules.org/dl).
The version used in this work is the initial release (rr01).
